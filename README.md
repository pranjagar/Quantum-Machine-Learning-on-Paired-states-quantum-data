'MLE_FUNCTIONS_Numpy.py' file is a module that is used in other files and it contains important definitions and functions used over and over again elsewhere.

The main results/plots for inversion method are in the file named 'Inversion_main.ipynb'.

The main results/plots for the optimization method are in the 'MLE_Opt_main.ipynb' file. 

Remaining other files are other intermediate/rough calculations and results.

The particular data used in each of the plots for optimization method is stored in corresponding CSV files, named in the format
"collapses_(the five parameters in degrees)_the number of trials per experiment_total number of experiments". Example: 'collapses_(30 120 45 90 30) 1k 1k.csv'
